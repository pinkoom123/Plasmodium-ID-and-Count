# Plasmodium-ID-and-Count
A basic Python code that reads parasitized red blood cell images from a folder, converts them to grayscale and then uses their morphology and colour traits
they exhibit when in red blood cells to identify the type of plasmodium parasite and count its number in the affected cells.
It uses four criteria. That is their dimension and colour. The dimensions of their developmental stages they exhibit (trophozoites, merozoites, and schizont stages).
Using the if clause, ensure all four criteria are satisfied before the parasite is called out and counted. All this is to be done within a time frame of one minute. Therefore, the time elapsed is estimated and printed alongside the total parasitic counts.
